Musical theatre costume designers are making scrubs for NHS medics working on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.
Sue Simmerling, the owner of costume design company Carry on Costumes, has volunteered the services of her team, who are already in the process of making 70 sets of scrubs for Guy's Hospital in London.
She was contacted by fellow designer Dulcie Scott, who started the crowdfunding group Helping Dress Medics, which aim is to purchase fabrics that are then made into protective clothing.
Ms Simmerling recently worked on costumes for the world premiere of Sleepless, A Musical Romance and show producers Michael Rose and Damien Sanders offered to share the costs with her to pay for 800 metres of fabric, which will be sent to seamstresses around the country.
A small independent music venue has a new project called Lock East to support local artists by sharing video content and their tracks.
The Smokehouse in Ipswich has had to close due to coronavirus lockdown, so the venue is offering them a new platform for performance.
"We may not be able to provide a physical stage, but we can provide a platform for new music from the area," said a spokesman for the South Street venue."Check out our Lock East platform at The Smokehouse . We want to hear from you. Send us your tracks."
