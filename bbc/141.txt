A world-champion vegetable grower says he could "probably feed the neighbourhood" with one of his outsize vegetables.
Kevin Fortey has grown the 23kg beetroot in his vegetable patch at his home in Cwmbran, south Wales.
He has previously won world records with chili, radish and beetroot and is currently growing lettuce, cabbage, beetroot and kol rabhi.
Mr Fortey urged others to do the same, saying: "There could easily be food shortages with production lines going down, but there doesn't have to be if people grow their own."
The 41-year-old added: "I usually use sowing and growing as a way to build the community but now we have to do our gardening on our own.
"But the thing is I will never be truly alone as I always have my veg for company."
A "thoughtful" garden centre worker has been thanked by his neighbours for leaving flowers on their doorstep.
David Barton, who works at Sprowston Garden Centre near Norwich, saved pot plants from going to waste while the business was closed during lockdown.
Last week, he put them outside front doors on his cul-de-sac in Sprowston, and was thanked on a community Facebook page.
"I canâ€™t thank [in person] the lovely man who just delivered this beautiful flower to my door," said one neighbour.
"Such a kind gesture in these tough times."
"It has certainly put a smile on my face," said another.
Mr Barton said: "With the situation at the moment there would not have been adequate staff to care for the houseplants.
"We decided to distribute to the local community so people could enjoy them while they were looking their best and spread some happiness in this uncertain time."
