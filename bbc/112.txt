The struggle for independence, land and power runs throughout Zimbabwe's modern history. Veteran President Robert Mugabe dominated the country's political scene for almost four decades after independence from Britain in 1980. 

Once the bread basket of the region, since 2000 Zimbabwe has struggled to feed its own people due to severe droughts and the effects of a land reform programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless Zimbabweans, with sharp falls in production.
The fall of Robert Mugabe in 2017 freed up politics and the media, but the country remains cash-strapped and impoverished.

President: Emmerson Mnangagwa
Emmerson Mnangagwa became president in November 2017 following a dramatic week in which the military took charge and Robert Mugabe resigned after 37 years in office.
After serving out Mr Mugabe's term, Mr Mnangagwa was narrowly re-elected as president in a July 2018 election. The result was questioned by his closest opponent, MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa.
Mr Mnangagwa previously served as first vice-president from 2014 until his dismissal on 6 November 2017. Two weeks later, the ruling Zanu-PF party sacked Mr Mugabe as leader and appointed Mr Mnangagwa as party president.
He took part in the fight for independence in the 1960s and has held several key roles since independence in 1980.
Known as "the crocodile" because of his political cunning, he was associated with some of worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party.
Since his election as president, he has pledged open government and a programme to stabilise the ruined economy and boost foreign investment, but price hikes and high underlying inflation have led to street protests.
All broadcasters in Zimbabwe, and many of the main newspapers, toe the government line.
Radio is the main source of information. The state-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) operates TV and radio networks and two national private radio stations are licensed.
