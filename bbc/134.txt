Veteran West Yorkshire-born actor Sir Patrick Stewart is among the ever-growing number of famous faces doing their best to raise people's spirits as the coronavirus lockdown continues.
The Star Trek and X-Men star, who's originally from Mirfield, is performing Shakespeare's sonnets, recording one a day and sharing it via his Twitter page.
Introducing the plan, he said: "When I was a child in the 1940s, my mother would cut up slices of fruit for me - there wasn't much - and as she put it in front of me she would say, 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away.' How about, 'A sonnet a day keeps the doctor away'?":

A Shakespeare-themed exhibition - inside a refurbished phone box - is to be unveiled to the public on Friday.
The moving sculpture outside the Mechanical Art and Design (MAD) Museum in Stratford-upon-Avon has been created by Swiss kinetic artist Pascal Bettex.
The MAD Museum is the only permanent museum of its kind in the UK which showcases over 90 pieces of kinetic art and automata.
Although the Museum own the phone box after it was decommissioned by BT, it must remain in place in Henley Street, it said.
