A set of eight miniature Hermès handbags were sold for HK$2.46million at Christie’s autumn sale. The lot sets a new world auction record.
The collection of bags, named Leather Forever Japan Star Bags, comprises of Hermès’ iconic models - including Birkin, Bolide, Constance, Faco, Farming, Kelly, Roulis and Toolbox. It was previously showcased at the Tokyo National Museum for Hermès’ Leather Forever exhibition in 2014.
“The strong sell-through rates were generated from active in-room, phone and online bidding, predominantly by Asian buyers,” says Matthew Rubinger, Senior Vice President & International Director, Handbags & Accessories for Asia & EMERI. “The successful sale reflects our strategy in sourcing only the most exquisite and rarest handbags and accessories that appeal to both new buyers and established collectors.”
The sale totalled more than HK$41million. Other highlights include other unique Hermès bags such as a crocodile diamond sellier Kelly 25 with 18K white gold and diamond hardwire which was sold for HK$1.12million.
