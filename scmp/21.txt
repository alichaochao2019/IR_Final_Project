Rodrigo Koxa has been credited with a world record for riding the biggest wave ever surfed. The World Surf League confirmed the record at its Big Wave Awards in Santa Monica over the weekend, saying its judging panel determined that a wave Koxa surfed at Naraze, Portugal, on November 8 was 80 feet (24.38 metres) high.
The Brazilian surfer’s mark overtook the record of 78 feet (23.77 metres) which Garrett McNamara set in 2011.
“The award goes to the surfer who, by any means available, catches the biggest wave of the year,” The WSL said in a statement. “Not only did Koxa win this year’s honour, but he now holds the Guinness world record for the biggest wave surfed. Koxa described the award as “a dream come true”.
