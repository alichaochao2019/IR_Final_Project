Having trouble finding your perfect scent? Francis Kurkdjian is your go-to man. The maestro of olfactive pyramid captures the scents of memory, characteristics and even ambience. Kurkdjian has impressive accolades under his belt, such as the award-winning Le Mâle for Jean Paul Gaultier and his amazing work of bringing the perfume of Marie Antoinette back to life. Maison Francis Kurkdjian’s latest offering is an ultra-exclusive scent for luxury Monte Carlo Yachts 105, which was unveiled last week in Venice. The ambient fragrance inspired by the journeys the yacht would embark on is available exclusively to the proud owners of the yacht.
STYLE took a front row seat at the unveiling event and sat down with Kurkdjian to talk about the unique scent as well as his bespoke perfume creations which will easily set you back over 15,000 euros per order. Watch out for our feature in the September issue of STYLE.
