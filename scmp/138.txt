It’s that time of year again. Billionaire entertainment mogul David Geffen has set sail on his US$590 million luxury yacht, “Rising Sun,” and as usual, he’s got a ton of boldface names with him, including the Obamas.
Last year, Karlie Kloss, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Mariah Carey were all pictured aboard the 454-foot megayacht.
This is David Geffen. He’s a founder of DreamWorks SKG, Asylum Records, Geffen Records, and DGC Records. He’s worth a reported US$7.4 billion.
Geffen owns “Rising Sun,” a 454-foot megayacht that was originally built for Oracle founder Larry Ellison.

Geffen bought a half-share in Ellison’s yacht in 2007, then another half in 2010, for a grand total of US$590 million.

The yacht can accommodate 18 guests and a staff of 55 people. It even has a basketball court.

It’s perfect for entertaining on the high seas.
Geffen has been touring the islands of French Polynesia over the past few weeks.

During this time, the Obamas were vacationing at a nearby exclusive resort, The Brando, on the private island of Tetiaroa.
But on Friday, the Obamas were spotted aboard Geffen’s yacht, just off the island of Moorea in the South Pacific. The couple spent the morning on the yacht before leaving French Polynesia, according to the photographer.
The Obamas joined Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks, and Bruce Springsteen as guests on the boat. Last summer, Geffen documented all of his celebrity friends who stayed on the yacht. Leonardo DiCaprio was aboard.

So was Karlie Kloss, who captioned her Instagram photo “The most magnificent weekend with the most extraordinary man.”
The model partied on the boat with Derek Blasberg and Dasha Zhukova, the wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.
Mariah Carey and her then-fiancé, billionaire James Packer, spent the Fourth of July in 2016 on the Rising Sun in Capri.

Rita Wilson, Gayle King, Paul McCartney, and Oprah also spent time on the yacht, as well as Julia Roberts and Maria Shriver.
And even when he’s not on his yacht, Geffen is surrounded by a celebrity crowd. Here, he’s pictured with Kloss, Princess Beatrice of York, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.
In August last year, Daily Mail US reported that Trump and Kushner were spotted on Geffen's yacht off the coast of Croatia.
