Five hundred thousand dollars can easily amount to the down payment on a small flat in Hong Kong, but to the rich "tai tais" in town, it's a small price to pay for a handbag.
That's no ordinary handbag, of course, but a Hermes Birkin creation, hand-made with precious animal skin, a symbol of fashion and status and a tradable asset all rolled into one.
At Christie's handbags and accessories auction yesterday - the first in Hong Kong - six Birkin bags sold for more than HK$500,000 each, sealing the Birkin's status as the coveted bag for the rich and famous.
Among the three top lots, all fetching HK$562,500 including the buyer's premium, was a matte graphite nilo crocodile Birkin made in 2012. Its pre-sale estimate was HK$450,000, excluding the buyer's premium.
Then there was a matte bleu de malte alligator Birkin, with a pre-sale estimate of HK$400,000. Commanding the same price was a limited-edition tri-colour ostrich ghillies Birkin, which almost doubled its pre-sale estimate of HK$280,000.
Conceived in 1981 and launched in 1984, the Birkin is named after English actress and singer Jane Birkin, who reportedly told then Hermes chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas to make a bag larger than the Kelly - another Hermes classic named after late Hollywood star Grace Kelly.
The Birkin's resale value is good, as proven by the success of shops trading second-hand designer bags, such as Milan Station.
Besides Hermes, a handful of bags from other brands including Chanel and Louis Vuitton were also among the 122 lots put up for sale, but their sale prices were only a fraction of the Birkins.
