Mandapa joins Dorado Beach and Phulay Bay in the Ritz-Carlton Reserve collection, which is soon to include a resort in Los Cabos.

Aimed at being a sanctuary from urban pace and pollution, the resort offers tailored spa facilities and wellness programmes.
A personal butler, or Patih, attends to each guest's specialised needs, and some villas feature a private pool.
Perhaps most appealing is the resort's location. Snaking through Ubud's lush green rice paddies, the Ayung River forms an oxbow that surrounds Mandapa and offers a serene setting â€“ and rafting for the more adventurous.
The resort organises cultural and historical experiences for guests wanting to explore the surrounding area, and Ubud's famed Kecak dances and orchestra performances are a short drive away.
