Travellers dreaming of a VVIP experience on board of a modified Boeing 787 can now do so with Deer Jet’s inaugural Hong Kong to Tahiti luxury flights.
Last week, the Chinese private jet operator announced the launch of a series of “Dream Journeys” that will take guests across the South Pacific Ocean towards French Polynesia.
The customised Boeing, or “Dream Jet”, is an ultra-long range private jet with a 220-square-metre cabin that houses private quarters for guests, the crew and butlers. It comes with a range of entertainment options to keep guests busy on a long flight, including an unlimited supply of luxury amenities.
The Dream Jet boasts large windows and a pressurised cabin 0.6 kilometre lower than other aircraft. The jet is set to deliver smoother rides and improved comfort in a quieter environment with cleaner air, the company says.
Deer Jet envisions a new era of private aviation by curating a line of bespoke journeys. In doing so, the company hopes to bring its signature services and amenities to a broader customer base and initiate a new model of travelling. Deer Jet says that “once at the destination, guests can uncover the magic of Tahiti as experienced by a selected few.”
China’s first private jet company manages a fleet of some 90 aircraft flying to 820 airports across 180 countries and regions. As a testament to its 22 years of industry experience, Deer Jet received the award for “World’s Best Private Jet Company” at the 2017 World Tourism Awards Ceremony in Istanbul. It was also crowned the “World’s Leading Private Jet Charter” last December for a second consecutive year by the World Travel Awards. It’s the first Asian private jet company to win this accolade.
