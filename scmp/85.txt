EVENT FENDI LEGENDS AND FAIRY TALES FASHION SHOW WHERE TREVI FOUNTAIN, ROME
Happenings: Fairy tales do come true. Fendi celebrates its 90th anniversary with a dreamy couture presentation as models walked down a transparent runway set up on top of Rome's iconic Trevi Fountain. The luxury maison supported the restoration of the heritage monument. Created by Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Fendi, the all-new couture collection features daring graphic designs inspired by a 1914 book of Danish fairy tales executed in utmost perfection thanks to the house's savoir faire. Celebrity front-rowers included Kate Hudson, Gong Li as well as Lindsey Wixson and the brand's CEO Pietro Beccari. Guests enjoyed an exclusive dinner at the nearby Terrazza del Pincio after the show.
OVERHEARD The show is truly the fashion moment of a lifetime.
CHIC CHAT with Pietro Beccari
Has it always been part of the plan to show at the Trevi Fountain?
It was brought up during early discussions and was definitely a dream [come true].
What were the main challenges?
Actually, the mayor of Rome changed [decisions] many times during the course of the restoration.
Fendi's headquarters is also a heritage monument in Rome. Why did you choose Rome?
I think the lighting is the most beautiful in Rome and, also, Rome is a very important city to us.
Why did you choose to focus on restoring fountains?
We launched the Fendi for Fountain campaign. We work closely with the city hall to choose restoration projects.
