The sky's the limit with Four Seasons, which has introduced a jet that lets you relax in luxury. With its interior and exterior created by the company's team of designers, passengers can enjoy exclusive bespoke journeys from the moment they book a trip. Guests can look forward to handcrafted leather flatbed seats, globally-inspired cuisine and the signature Four Seasons service, both on board and on the ground.
Global in-flight Wi-fi keeps guests and staff connected, so spa treatments, tee times, private excursions and more can be arranged "on the fly" to augment each itinerary. Reservations aboard the new Four Seasons jet are open for three routes, including two "Around the World" trips in February and August, and a "Backstage with the Arts" trip.
