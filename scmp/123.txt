In Kenya, the group will stay at Governors Camp at the Masai Mara Game Reserve. They will be able to see cheetahs, elephants, zebras, lions and hippos. There will be an elegant dinner at the Governors Camp compound in the wilds of Africa.
The group will also stay at Villa Rosa Kempinski in Nairobi and enjoy European luxury. Other itineraries include a traditional Tahitian fire-dancing performance at an exclusive Polynesian feast; scuba-diving, snorkelling, swimming, sailing and paddling through the crystalline waters surrounding Bora Bora to explore the island’s lush landscapes and rich history.
