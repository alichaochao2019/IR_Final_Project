But the comments of both Mr. Trump and a top official on the administration’s coronavirus response task force during the session suggested that the issue hasn’t been entirely resolved within the administration.“If people want to wear them, they can,” President Trump said, declaring that while the administration was “coming out with regulations” on mask wearing soon, whether to follow them was a personal choice.Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, sounded a sharper note of caution, saying that she did not want Americans to get a false sense of security from wearing masks. Washing hands and keeping six feet away from other people were more protective steps, she said, and suggested that the still-unannounced new guidance remained under debate.“The eyes are not in the mask. If you are touching things and touching your eyes, you’re exposing yourself in the same way,” Dr. Birx said. “This will be an additive piece if it comes out, rather than saying it is a substitute for it. It is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out.”During the same briefing, Dr. Birx suggested that despite all the harsh measures such as stay-at-home orders and business closures, the U.S. is not yet flattening the spike in new infections.“We have to change that slope. We have to change the logarithmic curve that we’re on,” she said of the steep increases in cases in many parts of the country. “We see country after country having done that, what it means in the United States is not everyone is doing it.”Dr. Birx said that recommendations against gatherings of more than 10 do not mean people should be having dinner parties or cocktail parties of less than 10 people.“We’re only as strong is every community, every county, every state, every American following the guidelines to a tee,” she said. “And I can tell by the curve, and as it is today that not every American is following it. And so this is really a call to action.”Her caveats on masks reflect what has been a common view among many public health bodies about the effectiveness of masks for the general public. Until now, the C.D.C., like the World Health Organization, has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason has been to preserve medical-grade masks, including N95 respirator masks, for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.Still, as the coronavirus devastates the United States, the C.D.C. has been drafting new guidelines recommending that everyone wear face coverings in public settings, like pharmacies and grocery stores, to avoid unwittingly spreading the virus, according to a federal official. Public health officials have continued to stress, however, that N95 masks and surgical masks should be saved for front-line doctors and nurses, who have been in dire need of protective gear. In the briefing, President Trump suggested that homemade face coverings, like scarves, would suffice.On Wednesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles urged a similar approach, suggesting that all of that city’s residents to wear homemade nonmedical face coverings, or even bandannas, when food shopping or doing other essential errands. Health officials in Riverside County, Calif., made a similar recommendation on Tuesday.Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration has had shifting positions on whether regular citizens should cover their faces in public.“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” the surgeon general, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, said in a tweet in late February. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”He was most concerned about widespread hoarding of the tightfitting N95 masks that can stop infectious particles even finer than a micron in diameter, and that even many health care workers have not been able to find.But earlier this week, Mr. Trump said that broad use of nonmedical masks, at least, was “certainly something we could discuss.”Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., confirmed in a radio interview earlier this week that the agency was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks. Citing new data that shows high rates of transmission from people who are infected but show no symptoms, he said the guidance on mask wearing was “being critically re-reviewed, to see if there’s potential additional value for individuals that are infected or individuals that may be asymptomatically infected.”While wearing masks to prevent the spread of disease is a widely accepted practice in many Asian countries, it remains to be seen how Americans would react to such a recommendation. But a growing number of public health experts have been recommending universal mask use.A recent white paper from the American Enterprise Institute had argued the move could have substantial public health benefits. One of its authors, the former F.D.A. commissioner Scott Gottlieb, had been forcefully advocating for the policy in media appearances.And a white paper from a group of Yale researchers released on Thursday estimated that universal mask use could reduce infections by around 10 percent, creating a value of $3,000 to $6,000 per American, based on estimates of the value of saved lives. The authors included Sten H. Vermund, the dean of the Yale School of Public Health, and Albert Ko, the chairman of Yale Medical School’s department of epidemiology and microbial diseases.Both papers recommended that members of the public wear homemade cloth masks, to preserve limited supplies of surgical masks and higher-grade respirators for health care workers.“It is critically important that public adoption not come at the expense of medical mask availability for health workers,” said Jason Abaluck, an associate professor of economics at the Yale School of Management and a co-author of the paper. “This is why we emphasize universal adoption of cloth masks.”The researchers emphasized that the primary benefit of mask wearing was to prevent infected people from spreading the virus by expelling infected droplets.Updated April 4, 2020The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.No. The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be available for 12 to18 months.Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”Advertisement
